So-Yeon  Yoon,"Lectures are crazy fast and confusing, and probably won't teach you design skills--get ready for Lynda. Projects take a lot of time and may cause crying/binge-eating pizza.

Alfred  Center,"Most practical classes at this university.3838 Very demanding and fair. So informative that many lazy and spoiled children whine about the difficulties that the material of his classes present. Lectures are useless. And he's grading is really arbitrary. At the end of the semester a lot of people had issues with the grade. He's a nice guy.  He really cares about his students.  He helps you get a job after graduation if you haven't found one.  He looks mean, but he's really a teddy bear. Very helpful once you prove you know what you're talking about, very intimidating otherwise.",[]

David Louis Pelletier,"NS 4600 is awful. Pelletier spends most of the lectures speaking about random things; the homework is unclear; literally no one has any idea what is going on at any point; no feedback is provided; he makes up arbitrary rules , etc. For a class designed around planning, the lack of a plan in this class is truly terrifying. He was decent Don't not take this course! It is very ambiguous and the tests demonstrate nothing from the lectures. he is a stickler on grades and makes his own grading scale that is different from the overall NS department scale. AVOID this course if you can awesome, fun, interesting course.","[""Skip class? You won't pass."", 'Get ready to read', 'Graded by few things']"

Prof Lujan is awesome (and quite attractive btw) Just took this course this past spring - wasn't too keen on anatomy but Prof Lujan made it fun and interesting.

Misako  Suzuki,"You have to REALLY want to learn Japanese to do well in this class. Suzuki is very nice, but she works hard and expects students to do so too. Great Professor. Teaches very clearly and is friendly all the time. In order to get an A, you DO have to attend every single lecture and discussion (a total of 7 times a week); be very well prepared every day and hand in every homework on time. This way, you will find Japanese interesting. Overall, you will learn a lot in her class, and have fun. Suzuki sensee is a stickler in class for being prepared, but overall, nice and helpful. Suzuki is too sweet :) Suzuki-sensei is the most professional person I have met at this university. She is always SO prepared, but still seems very relaxed and natural in class.",[]

Claire T. Cardie,"So disorganized, unclear lectures Professor Cardie herself is accessible and tries to be helpful. However, the rest of the course stuff was disorganized and it felt like Professor Cardie was out-of-loop regarding her own class, especially in terms of the assignments. Very interesting class but beware the projects, very open-ended, unclear and time consuming. This class was very interesting, and the programming assignments, while long, were excellent. Professor Cardie was frequently quite unclear with concepts, and Piazza was very seldom used by the instructors, so it would take a long time to get what was quite often a less-than-helpful response. Assignments were graded easily, but the final was tough. Lectures can be a little dry (and she sometimes seems a bit nervous?) but Prof Cardie is super nice and helpful in person. Programming projects are interesting and not too hard. Needs to hire better or more TAs, though - I've taken both IR and NLP with her and both times the TA team was sub-par wrt to responsiveness and knowing what's going on. Information Retrieval is an interesting class. Claire is a pretty good lecturer, and bring her dog to class often.  The one major flaw for this course was the grading structure, which as fairly ambiguous. This year 60% of the grade came from 3 problem sets, which were not easy.  The pacing of the course is good, and Claire is willing to help you.","['Participation matters', 'Tests? Not many', 'Lecture heavy', 'Accessible outside class']"

Edward Eugene Baptist,"Mean guy. Horrible lecturer that will put you to sleep every time. very unreasonable and gives off bad vibes. lecture is all over the place and class has no structure. Not too hard depending on your TA Mean guy. Unreasonable. Probably unhappy with his life -- I've heard stories about him only justified by extreme unhappiness with his own life. After taking his class, he changed my entire perception of academia and confirmed the suspicion ""those who cannot do, teach."" Fears face-to-face confrontations. Baptist is a nice guy and knows a ton but only an OK lecturer. Kind of rambles on and gets off topic easily. Lectures have nothing to do with what the tests are on. Assigned readings are very specific and pretty interesting. Discussion sections were pretty boring. Class was not as interesting as I thought it would be. Prof. Baptist's Obama and Lincoln course was extremely informative. Some called the course premature but it was probably one of the best courses I've taken at Cornell. Baptist is very helpful during office hours and deeply cares about his students' opinions. Yes, he is a stickler for clear writing but what professor isn't? I highly recommend him! A bit dry in lecture, but extremely knowledgeable about the subject. Chooses great books. As aren't impossible if you write clearly and ALWAYS check your work for errors.",[]

Jery Russell Stedinger,"Stuff is substantial but EXTREMELY confusing. Ridiculous Hw grading. Very confusing lectures. Essentially took what might have been very simple statistics topics and made them as confusing and impossible to understand as possible. Would not take this class again, and it was that feeling that pushed me to do my best to pass this class-- I didn't ever want to come back. This feeling was shared by most of the class. Assigns a ton of work and the course is pretty irrelevant. He's been teaching the same course for years and clearly doesn't actually change much. Prof Stedinger definitely knows his material, but the way he teaches it can get confusing. He's hilarious, but sometimes it detracts from the lecture. He takes feedback for the class very seriously. Overall, Stedinger is a decent professor. Overall decent prof. He can be confusing in lecture sometimes, but he's very approachable for help if you need it. He's also a hilarious guy!","['Tough grader', 'Lots of homework', 'Lecture heavy']"

Bruce R. Kusse,"Great guy. He doesn't even make us add. He knows what he's talking about. Looks like Adam West, but he's still my favorite all time professor!  You better know your math though! This is the only professor I didn't like that I would recommend. He doesn't sound like he is speaking to the class when he is teaching, which is weird. He wrote the textbook and teaches word for word from the book. The class covers chapters 10-15, which are totally unrelated. He is a very serious person, but intends to be helpful I think. Best math class ever. I am a practicing engineer and constantly go back to the book/notes. Kisses rocks. Kusse is one of the most iconic professors you will ever have. Students will fear him and love him at the same time. He knows his material, but isn't the most willing to look at problems another way or admit he is wrong. In any case, he's a cornerstone to the AEP degree, so you might as well learn to love him.","['Inspirational', 'Hilarious', 'Caring']"

The best professor I have had in the department. His lectures are interesting, fun and challenging. Although he sometimes talks in circles, he is still great to listen to for 90 minutes. His tests are hard, but he is really fair and always available for help. Highly recommended, I learned a lot! Great guy, all around. The nicest, most helpful professors I've had at Cornell. The class sucked but it's not his fault; econometrics is hard and required. However, he made it as enjoyable as possible (albeit that is still not very enjoyable). I highly recommend taking a (different) class with him.  He'll bend over backward to help any student! One of the hardest PAM classes. If not the hardest.  what makes this class rough is 1) PSETS: very, very long, from 10-25 hours, and 2) STATA (which you need for psets), 3) ridiculous exams that are way too crammed for the alotted time.

David Hines Holmberg,"Lectures are boring, talks about one main culture in class and leaves it up to the TA's to discuss the readings in section. Lots of reading, but overall not a difficult class. Pop quizzes have really specific information on them.  Lectures are so boring, lots and lots of reading assignments, however, material is not terribly difficult. Requires 2 essays and also give pop quizzes on readings My problem with Prof. Holmberg is that he doesn't really teach anything useful. Instead of focusing on the broader subject of Anthropology, he expects students to know things about the specific cultures studies in class. His lectures are not organized at all, making it difficult to take good notes. Assigns a lot of reading, and tests on all of it. Professor Holmberg is a really interesting guy. He is very passionate and he clearly loves what he teaches. Myth Ritual and Symbol was a GREAT class. It was incredibly interesting and I learned so much. Lots of reading, but its all interesting and almost fun to read. Take this class! His lectures are interesting and you can tell he loves the subject, but his voice is incredibly soporific. As long as you pay attention to class and do the readings (lectures and readings cover completely different material) you will be fine. Pretty easy grader overall.","['Get ready to read', 'Beware of pop quizzes', 'Lecture heavy']"

Probably the best professor I've had here. He goes through a lot of material but he makes it wildly interesting. Additionally, he really cares about his students doing well and he goes out of his way to help. Definitely the most interested, interesting, and caring professor I've seen. Probably the best class I've taken here. Dr. Bowman is extremely interested in what he is teaching and in doing whatever he can to help his students do well. The material isn't easy, but it's wildly interesting and Dr. Bowman makes it fun. I definitely recommend giving this class a try. Too much information on slides. Slides are poorly organized with no structure to them. Talks too quickly, glosses over topics such that lectures becomes confusing. Exams are difficult and require LOTS of memorization of detail. Final is comprehensive, ridiculous given how many parasites are covered. Tests are very hard. Have to remember many species and specific details about life cycles, length, location. It is way too much information and detail to remember for each exam.  Too much details on slides, and need to memorize huge amounts of info. Can't cram for exams. Hard exams.",[]

Edwin (Todd)  Cowen,"His lectures were fun, wish that I could've gone as an audience member only, not a student who needed to take notes and worry about how crazy hard this course was the whole time. Time consuming homework: yes. Tests were extraordinarily difficult: yes. Lab was good enough, I suppose. He needs better TAs too, but everything in this course needs work. I took CEE fluids instead of BEE's (despite being a BEE major) because I'd heard good things about Cowen. In the end, I was not disappointed. When I was almost on track to fail, Cowen was very encouraging and helpful. He got me through the class. Lectures were sometimes boring, but could be pretty interesting at other times. Class is pretty tough - the problem sets are long and involved and the exams are pretty difficult, even though they're open note/book.  Cowen is nice though, and the labs are kinda cool.  It seems boring at first, but the class gets more interesting as it goes along.  Textbook was very helpful. good professor. the lecture notes are really helpful when it comes to test time. also, the best dressed professor in engineering. He is a nice guy that wants you to do well. But, his tests are far from easy- open note, book and twice as much time as you need. If you work hard, you can do well.

Adeolu Aderinola Ademoyo,"Compared to other language courses, this is definitely one of the best options. He is EXTREMELY disorganized which makes the course much more stressful, but he ultimately gives everyone a good grade (A- or above), unless you are really bad then maybe he'll give you a B+. Much less work than other language classes. He acts a lot and is fun also! He's a good professor, his grading is haphazard though and there's more emphasis on speaking the language than actual tests I really enjoyed this class! ADEMOYO IS A GREAT PROFESSOR! He aims to have his students learn the material but does not overwhelm them. The class is totally manageable and the professor is extremely helpful. Best language class I've EVER taken :) Insane teacher!! Really animated and funny. Subtly disguises heavy philosophy in jokes. A good class to have in Freshman year. Very nice professor. Likes to encourage students. Informs us on ongoing political and cultural issues. He's very animated and enthusiastic about teaching. Sometimes he's a little too nice to undeserving students. It's not even a hard class! Simply attend and learn Yoruba (the best language and people in the world! :-) )",[]

Samantha  Zacher,"This class one so well thought out. There was a flow between topics that really made sense and the texts we read were fun! (Especially the section on John Mandeville). Would highly recommend taking a course from Professor Zacher!  As my first four-thousand level English course, especially one on the roots of anti-Semitism, I was nervous as to what this class would be like. Professor Zacher was amazing. Not only did she her happy energy lighten some of the heavy readings, every lecture was engaging. This class (and its professor) are wonderful. Would recommend highly! Professor Zacher is incredibly knowledgeable, funny, and gets you thinking far beyond the classroom in ""The Imaginary Jew."" The course is a brilliant interweaving of films, manuscripts, books, and poems. There is lot of writing (which was a good thing) but the class was not only English majors. Fascinating and very well taught- TAKE THIS CLASS Professor Samantha Zacher is an incredibly warm, funny, engaging individual. Her enthusiasm and her teaching abilities make class easy and really enjoyable. She is also invested in her students and their work. She takes the time to read and comment closely on your papers, improving your knowledge and your writing abilities at the same time. I love Professor Zacher!  She made an obscure topic (Icelandic lit) fascinating by her enthusiasm and obvious expertise.  She wants her students to do well and learn and is willing to spend time helping them do so.  Her class was not easy, but it was not stressful either.  If for no other reason, take her class to learn how to be chic!","['Gives good feedback', 'Hilarious', 'Would take again', 'Respected']"

Especially for seniors this class is an absolute waste of time. So here's the deal. It's easy to get into the habit of being annoyed by Rick. He gives a LOT of handouts that he reads to you, and then some of his discussions are boring. But Rick wants you to learn something, through his lectures and through the project he assigns. If you put in work on the project, and participate in class, you'll get an A. Rick is a nice guy and helpfup. However, his classes were ridiculously pointless. He spends each class giving students 2-4 handouts then reading them word for word, as if we couldn't read. He talks about genres and abstract things, then gives you assignments he has told you nothing about. The material is easy but he is BORING. Waste of my tuition. Professor Evans is a great professor. He is extremely helpful with anything a student might need help with and always very enthusiastic.

Her positive and funny attitude makes the class fun and interesting. I hope all my Spanish professors are like her. She does not give the positive feedback that is necessary for a mid-level language class. Instead of encouraging students to speak and building their confidence with their oral skills, she focuses on the one gramatical thing they get wrong, resulting in a lot of kids remaining quiet and never volunteering for fear of getting shut down.

She made it really hard to ask questions, and even intimidated some students for that. She did not say ""I don't know."" even once, which is really unexpected for such an advanced level class. Kim was my favorite physics prof. from the honors intro sequence. She provides the lecture notes in advance which makes most lectures much easier to follow. While 1116 & 2217 required more intuitive thinking to solve crazy problems, 2218 dealt more with becoming familiar with more technical problems. Uses the definite articles incorrrectly at time. Professor Kim is very organized, and has great lecture notes. That being said, you have to put in a lot of work outside class (reading the textbook, etc) to learn the material. Homework isn't always related to lecture, but she's still organized and willing to help. The problem sets and prelims are fair so far, and I'm learning a lot in the class. The lectures are pretty clear too and accompany the readings well.",['Tough grader']

He's a funny guy and super enthusiastic about the content. Definitely would recommend. (1300 is a bit of work though). Surprisingly well spoken teacher. I really enjoyed the class and it wasn't too tough. I usually give teachers low marks on this site, but I truly give danco a 5/5. He's so personable - it's almost as if he was a student here as opposed to a teacher. Highly recommend this class / teacher Had a few years ago, and it felt like being trolled; have not commented b/c it seemed like just a bad personal fit. But looking back, realized something: he's clueless about differences of learning styles and situations in his students.

Totally teh best .  Intelligent, extremely knowledgable, very helpful.  Totally above the extraordinary. Prof. Ndulo was awarded one of three recipients of the first annual Awards for Excellence in the Teaching, Advising and Mentoring of Graduate and Professional Students. This is an excellent professor and engages his students in practical application of the law. The kindest professor you'll ever meet; so approachable, helpful and easy to talk to. His classes were really interesting and he was very engaging. I highly recommend his International Criminal Law seminar! Professor Ndulo is an awesome professor.  He has travelled to some hot spots  (Kosovo, East Timor, Afghanistan, South Africa)and brings his experience into his classroom which rocks!  PhD from Oxford, LLM from Harvard, knows his stuff!  Very helpful, strict but very approachable.His International Law and Foreign Direct Investment is the best !",[]

Pretty picky when he grades his long papers but you have plenty of time to do them. You can skip class and forgo the grade bump but make sure to not get lost. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS PERIOD!!  His grading is harsh and condescending considering he doesn't give any guidence or instruction on assignment requirements. He loses and forgets everything. He needs to retire. Worst class ever. Don't take the course...not even to fill a requirement. The instructor was unprepared,disorganized & just plain terrible. His knowledge of the material was good; however, his disorganization made myself and others grow disinterested with the course. There was quite a bit of ambiguity surrounding grading rubric. You basically didn't find out what his requirements were until after the fact. He was rude. Very interesting guy. Very interested in what he teachers about.  Great sense of humor.

Yongmiao  Hong,"Man knows his stuff and his lectures are alright, albeit boring. However, he gives very few things that determine grade (10% HW, 35% Midterm, 55% Final) so your grade may suffer. Also rarely shows up to office hours, so it's very hard to get help from him. Even making appointments doesn't help - he just forgets. If you haven't taken the equivalent of Calc III or more, do not take this class. I mean it, just don't. Calc III material is ""introduced"" with one or two examples in a lecture, with the rest of the lecture relying upon that prerequisite knowledge. Also class only has a midterm and a final, so your grade is up in the air for the entire semester. Make sure you go to class. Lectures are extremely boring and make you want to go to sleep, but they're definitely important. Memorize the lecture notes if you want to do well. Do NOT only practice the HW problems because you will fail the midterm like half the class did (including me). Grading is left to the TAs, so can be rather harsh, With the new changes to the department, He decided to make the class ridiculously hard. Handed out really easy psets and practice midterms only to give the class an extremely hard midterm (average was a C-). If you want to take this course, (1) you have to love theoretical math. If you don't, don't take the class. (2) memorize his lecture notes. Definitely one of the top few professors in the Economics department! Although his accent is a bit heavy, you get used to it after a few classes if you're willing to listen. He's extremely clear with his explanations and writes very easy exams. However, he leaves too much in the hands of his TAs so grading turned out a bit harsh despite easy exams.","['Tough grader', ""Skip class? You won't pass."", 'Tests?

I found the class to be very informative even though it was a lot of work. Professor Rickard is very knowledgable on the theory behind Native issues, but students without any background knowledge (attended American schools) may have found the class difficult to grasp. And in reality she was a fair grader, hard word was rewarded. Jolene took time out of her insanely busy schedule as interim director of the Arts dept to work with me on an independent study project on settler colonialism, imaging & resistance. I found her to be, in contrast with most of these comments, a dynamic & challenging teacher who genuinely cares for students-their development but also well-being.

No grading criteria, 1 week for writing assignments that are worth 50% of the final grade, & poor organization makes the class difficult to participate in & enjoy.

But, he was very helpful in office hours and provided lots of advice on the major project (""designing"" a nuclear reactor). HW was vital to clarifying the actual course expectations. Hammer is an amazing lecturer, being clear, informative, and engaging. He is approachable, friendly, and very knowledgeable. The material for fusion is difficult, like Physics 2214 on crack.  Fusion weekly HW takes 4-7 hours.  Do well on the final project!   Expect B+/A- median grades for Fusion and a free A for attendance for Energy Seminar. Amazing teacher! The class is hard - but he's so helpful and always available in his office. GREAT GUY ! Very very helpful :) His is an amazing teacher.

Don't take his classes if you want to get any value whatsoever out of the thousands of dollars in tuition you are spending. Every now and again, Cornell adds a new professor who is phenomenal. Mr. Karpman is not that professor. Though nice and soft spoken, expect to be left confused and bewildered about basic business topics. After you are left even more confused about business topics, expect to be equally perplexed by his grading scheme Poor lesson plan. Chronically disorganized. Intelligent professor, but quite organized. The guess lecturers are very interesting but there is no clear cut way grades are calculated. Interesting material but his presentations and lectures were certainly lacking in details, and tangible examples. As far as Cornell professors go, he easily falls into the mid lower rankings.","['Tough grader', 'Lecture heavy', ""Skip class? You won't pass."", 'Group projects', 'Clear grading criteria']"

I really enjoyed my Viet classes at Cornell with co Thuy. Shes an effective teacher who's very generous with her grades. She gave me a solid foundation of Viet & cared about my progress and career goals. She listened to my concerns & got to know me. She continues to be a supportive mentor/friend even after Cornell. Co Thuy is an amazing professor! Had her as a teacher for almost two years. The courses are challenging, but fun as you bond with your classmates in a casual ambiance. If you keep up with the homework, you'll do great in the class. As a teacher, she wants all her students to succeed and learn the language. However, the student must show the initiative. Overall, great class. take any other language This instructor is very inconsistent with regards to her instruction.  She often grades based on her mood at the particular day and time she is looking at your work.  Lacks motivational skills and often pits students against each other for the sack of unhealthy student competition.  Lacks any healthy professionalism.","[""Skip class? You won't pass.""]"

Very bright professor, but acts as if teaching is an inconvenience. Not too concerned with whether or not you understand.   If you're going to take this class, expect to clarify concepts for yourself outside of class. You're better off not asking any questions.  Moves through the material too quickly, not very clear. Stressful at times, but if you work hard outside of class to understand the material, you'll be fine.  Unbelievably unorganized ..

Levon  Barseghyan,"Great lecturer, makes the material easy to learn through powerpointsin-depth lectures. Easy to get at least an A- if you have a tough semester, easy A if you have more time. Dont get the textbook its only used for a few problem sets. Oh and if you want to learn how to become a ForEx trader from a crazy Armenian then this is the course for you. A good professor to take if you're not really interested in macroeconomics. If you go to lecture and actually do the homework, it's pretty hard not to get at least an A-. Personally, I was kind of disappointed at the lack of quantitative work we did in his class, but it might just be that macroeconomics doesn't use that much math to begin with. Barseghyan is hilarious. His lectures are full of jokes and references to Armenia. He is truly passionate about economics and tries to instil an interest in the students. However, he's not the strongest lecturer. He often just kinda paraphrases right through what you have to learn and ignores the syllabus. Never used the textbook except for hw.  Someone with real talent at jokes and supplement materials, sometimes they will last through the whole lecture. His exams are straight forward but it does require you to do a lot of self studies, especially when he vanishes right after class. Overall a good experience. Funny/entertaining lecturer but not the best teacher ever. Never uses the textbook. Don't really have to know the calculus because he doesn't ask questions that require it/you only have to regurgitate the information. I believe he curves to a B or B+. Interactive class atmosphere in which he often calls people out.","['Amazing lectures', 'Inspirational', 'Would take again', 'Hilarious']"

Cant manage to say a full English sentence without stopping at least eight times. Extremely boring seminars. Definitely would not recommend. Thought it'd be an easy A, but you def have to work for it. 1 midterm, 1 final, 1 paper makes up your grade primarily. MC questions are VERY specific, so you must read each reading carefully and take good notes so you can review before test. Essay was easy and fun. Night screenings were annoying, but only 1 lecture a week, along w/ one discussion. Easy and very interesting class, easy professor. Doesn't use powerpoints or handouts, so you need to go to class and write down what he says. Midterm and final are verbatim from the lecture, and the final paper is fun and very leniently graded. Sitting through 'utopia in theory and in practice' became more and more difficult as the year went on. Readings are interesting, material is interesting, but David is not. If he could pry his hand away from his face long enough to say something intelligent I might then recommend this course.Since that seems unlikely, I cannot.

Prof. Nee's class is a great intro to sociology, and you don't need any prior knowledge. He loves his work and connects the big ideas to examples at Cornell, which is helpful. Not the most engaging discussion leader and the readings can be a bit dry. If you keep up and participate passing should be no problem.

Follow along in class and interact with the ideas, and you will do well. The class is definitely worthwhile and highly recommended. Easy A if you follow lectures and skim through readings.

She will frequently go off topic which can make lecture frustrating. Cherney is super nice and cares a lot about her students.  Knows students have a life and other classes, and she is often willing to relax a deadline  for projects/assignments. For those who think she doesn't care: simply not true. She's extremely busy (just take a look at her office & desk) and does her best to make time to help students succeed! horrible professor, does not pay attention at all in lecture and teaches us useless information just by reading off of the powerpoints she makes Can be confusing at times, but generally a good professor. Cherney is very fair and gives you a good idea of what to expect on tests, etc. Genuinely cares about the success of her students. Great discussion-based class, which is hard to find in most science departments.

Good professor. Expects a fair amount of work, but is very fair on grading. She also tries very hard to build the class around the interests and suggestions of her students. Discussions could be more stimulating, but overall a good professor and an interesting class with wonderful assignments. Just alright professor. She seems fairly nice but her rhetoric falls flat as soon as she begins to grade papers, makes you think twice about her character. However, the class was a pleasant break from the day.

He definitely knows what he's talking about, but isn't as pretentious as most musicologists and doesn't look down on you if you don't know what he's talking about. Extremely helpful and kind hearted...but he knows when you're bs-ing, so don't. pretentious and off-putting. still informative and a genius... Prof. Zaslaw is the most knowledgeable man I think I've met at Cornell.  The man is one of the world's foremost musicologists!  Loves what he does, isn't as old school as you would think, and really wants you to do well and love music.  Great class but memorizing symphonies/operas was challenging.",[]

Flavien T. Glidja,"Awful. This class made me hate French and dread attending class everyday. If you are teaching a 1220 class, most people shouldnt be on the brink of failing the first exam. If you have TAs, they should be allowed to teach and see exams because they are there to learn to. A miserable and regrettable experience. Flavien has unrealistic expectations in terms of how much time students can allocate to French every day. We are full time students with loads of classes and work. He doesn't understand that. 1220 was quite possibly the most miserable class I've ever taken. (ONE PRO- grading is weighted over lots of things (exams, hw, writing, etc)) Don't do it. Flavian is the man. If you want to improve your French, he'll help you do it, although it does get challenging and work-intensive at times, but is TOTALLY worth it. He does a great job of clearly explaining everything, and makes it fun. On top of that, he has a great attitude towards life that everyone can learn from. Flavien is a fabulous teacher who genuinely cares about his students. He is from Benin and has an interesting story  if you get to talk to him outside of class. Cool accent! I had him for French 209 back in Spring 2009. I was mistakenly placed in the class, so it was easy for me. The book was stupid so I just photocopied it from the libe. Flavien is a very good teacher. He makes sure his students understand the material, and will never refuse a question. This class is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, but Flavien does his best to make the material fun (organizing debates, making and acting out plays) Cornell is lucky to have Flavien.","['Lots of homework', 'Tough grader', 'Participation matters', ""Skip class?

Really easy and helpful, but definitely an extremely dry lecture. Boring, but gets the job done. He's a very nice professor, lively and into what he teaches. The information is pretty self explanatory or common sense stuff. He's very responsive to student feedback and makes adjustments accordingly, like improving his tests or notes. Didn't really need to read the book, lectures cover most of the info. Makes it easy/wants you to do well Awesome. Prof. Lewenstein is one of the nicest people around. As already mentioned, the material is somewhat dry and ""duh"" but he makes it interesting and makes you think about the various aspects of science communication.

The TAs in this class are your best friends. I highly recommend Dr. Wu's microfluidics course. The labs were suitably challenging and the lectures were generally fun and laid-back. No exams - grades are largely determined by group lab reports and final presentation. Dr. Wu has been very kind and helpful to the students. Incoherent, clueless - shouldn't be teaching a class.

Really interested in what students have to say and interested in challenging opinions without being condescending. Class was always an adventure/unpredictable: you never know what crazy video or photo he'll show next. Has wide ranging wealth of knowledge, and seems interested in learning from his students as well. sounded like an interesting class and the syllabus mentioned art projects...WRONG. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! The professor is arrogant, incomprehensible, and the TA was harsh on papers/tests. It was the class i took for ""fun"" and yet it will be bringing down my average! Murray is NOT intelligent and loads his class with **** papers and lectures!! Class is easy when doing the work on your own, but sitting in Murrays classroom is a frustrating experience.  Hes disorganized  and its hard to take notes.  Hes also very arrogant & opinionated, sharing his political opinions as class fact.  He showed the class irrelevant anti-israel materials and tested us on them. Extremely anal about attendance! The class sounds very interesting but it only touches many cool subjects-too many. We read a lot of super nuanced essays but they were too removed from the original material and were not expanded upon in class.

Susan  Daniel,"Her methods for solving problems are pretty much irrelevant to the course but content was nothing too earth-shattering to begin with so it really didn't matter. She's not looking to screw anyone over in terms of grades and her tests are pretty fair. Projects were interesting applications of the material but often took way too much time to complete. Lecture has proven to be useless, so is the discussion. Course is challenging in the sense that the homework does not prepare you for the exam. Projects are meaningless and time consuming. Highly recommend using Course Hero to redo the old prelims. Overall bad course. Prof Daniel is sweet woman. She sincerely cares about your success. However, I don't particularly like her teaching style of constant examples, and you learn a significant amount of useless material that will never be seen for the rest of the class. Although she makes a few errors in lecture, she is very sweet and sincerely wants you to do well (compare to other ENGR profs who want to assert their intelligence and make you feel stupid). The material can be a little tricky and tedious but with the amount of help available only sincere effort is required to do well. I did not put an ounce of work on this class. The material itself is very dry, but she tries her best to explain and solve a lot of examples. She's a really nice and helpful professor, but I just hated the course, so I skipped most lectures. It is really easy to just get a B, which is actually the mean for this class. Advice: don't copy solutions",[]

The workload was comfortable and she gave helpful feedback, and discussions were always interesting.  I plan to take more classes with her in the future.

She sincerely cares about all of her students.  She actually does end lectures on time and tries to make them interesting despite some dry material mandated by the DI classes. I don't think there is anyone who remembers Emily fondly. Doesn't teach much, spends too much time trying to be friendly which doesn't work because she screws everyone on the test.

I didn't understand why he taught subjects in the order he did confusing. He was awful at lecturing and condescending towards undergraduate students. He had a very poor grasp of what sophomore-level ECEs should already know or what they haven't learned it. I could barely sit through each lecture.  Lecture notes are helpful. HWs were Q's off the text, though I wish he put his own questions. Exams were unstable in difficulty. He's not bad though and he's funny sometimes. He means well too, because he wants to consider our feedback on the course to hopefully run it in a more stable manner. This was his first time teaching 2200 I think.

The readings in this class will KILL if you let them accumulate. DO NOT LET THEM PILE UP. She gives tons of reading, and you need to do them to pass. Her lectures are also incredibly long and boring but are ESSENTIAL to passing and tests- get ready to take the longest notes during lectures. Professor Washington is also an incredibly tough grader. She is great, and really cares about her students learning the material, and goes out of her way to create extra resources for this.  She's definitely not 'scary'as another poster said, quite the opposite.  Definitely tough assignments but just put in the work, it's worth it. If you're going into a class for American history with a very strong focus on African American history, then this class is it. Washington is not the most friendly or accommodating professor and this can be a turnoff. Tests are unfair in that it is based on how fast you can write as opposed to actual understanding. Overall, not a class I would recom Marge Washington is a scary woman! She's a very good lecturer but her test are INSANELY hard and there is a SH*t load of reading.

The class itself is very interesting, and the material is presented in an engaging way. Schaffer himself is not very helpful, though.

Allen R. Carlson,"This course involves tons of reading. Interesting lecturer, just lots of work. Carlson is a very solid and nice, if uninspiring professor. His lectures are always clear and if you're interested in China he sufficiently will stimulate it. Workload is easy too. However, he is very disorganized (not giving out assignments in time, always being late, etc) Professor Carlson's lectures are extremely boring and he never replies any emails. But it is an easy class with easy grading.Read the materials and go to lecture regulatory will almost guarantee you an A range grade. Ok. I dont know if he does this because he got tenure but he NEVER replies to your emails. If he does, it is after several days or weeks. I would never take his course again. Useless powerpoint and a ridiculous amount of reading, but Carlson is a GREAT professor nonetheless. He really knows his stuff and loves what he does.

Boring at times, extremely interesting otherwise. Lots of long essay writing unfortunately. Interesting, but a LOT of material. Readings tedious at times, I ended up skimming a lot. Lectures LONG; prof mostly lectured nonstop, reading from her notes for 75 mins while students struggled to keep up with notes; no visual aids such as powerpoints.

Victoria A. Beard,"The lectures are very repetitive and are given to further specific points. There isn't much balance of views and much of the class is spent on things that would be obvious to students from the Global South. Most of the grade comes from a large group project, which is a pain in and of itself, and she tries to help but is unclear about grading . She really knows the subject matter and has a lot of experience, but that comes out when she is lecturing and you cannot keep up with broad concepts. Classes are fast passed; don't even try writing everything on the slides down. Understand the readings in depth and use examples from class and you will be alright. Grade broken down into midterm, final , and GROUP research paper. Not very hard to pass, but going to class helps. Readings can be interesting, but skim the long ones, of which there are quite a few. Group research paper is not the worst thing in the world, but it's pretty bad. Good class to take as a pre-req for upper level courses. Although the final grade is not reflective of what  one's gained (only 2 tests, and 1 group essay where everyone gets the same gradethis sucked), the content is interesting, applicable, and clear to understand, and Professor Beard is very nice. The guest lecturers were also very interesting. Not a time consuming class. First year teaching the class and was terrible. Lectures were very unclear and had way too much information. The final grade is only based on your midterm, 45 page research paper, and final exam. Not even a discussion section for this class. Terrible class altogether!","['Group projects', 'Tough grader', 'Get ready to read', 'Would take again', 'Respected']"

Terry  Herter,"I came into this class really excited to learn about astronomy but I walked out feeling disappointed.  This course is pretty dry with some interesting topics towards the end of the semester.  Professor Herter's prelims and final are not hard as long as you do the practice tests and memorize stuff from lecture slides.  Easy class but very very dry. He basically reads off the slides, and I find the lectures pretty useless as all the slide are online. The discussions are a lot more helpful. He's the kind of professor you want to like, and he tries to keep things interesting with demos and things, but he goes off on a lot of boring tangents and gives too many pointless examples and slideshows. If I could describe Terry Herter in one word, it would be bouncy.  This man bounces up and down on his toes like a pogo stick and is very perky/bubbly/weird/funny.  Class is more organized than ASTR 102 and therefore easier.   Not necessary to even open the book; all you need is in the lecture slides. There is not tons of chem and physics, that's a lie. It's a great class, you learn a ton, and it's relatively easy. Herter is great, funny, hilarious, nerdy, and willing to help. Take the lab--it's easy and = extra points. Highly recommened. Professor Herter is effing hilarious; he uses several demonstrations that are so wild you can't help but laugh at them.  He's very unassuming and willing to help anyone.",[]

However, the class itself is super disorganized and nanotech is such a broad topic that it sometimes seems like we're just learning random stuff. Prelims were okay, but quizzes were pretty bad exactly what others talk about. He expects too much prior knowledge about chem and physics even if its engri class and the class is really boring and long. Great professor! Definitely take as prospective ChemE or MatSci Umbach, although tough, is an entertaining lecturer and a kind professor. Arguably, Nanotechnology is one of the hardest ENGRI classes, and as such, many people are disappointed with workload. However, the class was inspirational, and it completely changed my personal career path; as such, I highly recommend the class for motivated individuals Decent professor. His lecture notes are extremely dense, but he posts all the power points which are very convenient for reviewing for prelims. For the most part the tests are fair. The homeworks didn't seem particularly useful but they weren't very hard. The material is often interesting, other times not so much. Overall a decent experience","[""Skip class?

Mark E. Lewis,"Mark Lewis is like Brock Lesnar. He looks good on the outside, but he sucks actually.  Took this class with dual-professor, Lewis and Dai. Compared to Dai, Lewis is a joke. He lectures about his daughter and answers cell phones in class. His tests cover everything, but involve redundant crazy computations. Also, the extra credit questions ask about her daughter's gymnastic score. I mean, WTF. As a person, Lewis is a great guy. Funny, interesting to talk to and willing to help. But he is a terrible lecturer and orator. Spent most of the time talking about random stuff and his life. However, tests were easy and I learned most of the class from the textbook and discussion. Prof Lewis is a love or hate type of guy. I personally really enjoyed coming to class. He loves to tell funny stories and keep the class engaged. Many complain that he is a bad lecturer, but I think that the material is understandable and not that hard if one pays attention and reads the book outside of class. He is one of my favorite profs so far. Spent more time talking about personal life than lecturing on material.  Also, terrible at explaining material.

Roberto G. Bertoia,"Professor Bertoia looks intimidating at first but is really a friendly guy who loves what he teaches. He assigned projects that were very time consuming to complete, but was always willing to offer guidance and help. There wasn't much freedom in what we were allowed to sculpt, but this is understandable since it's an introductory class. Bob is heavily invested in the aesthetic and technical approach of sculpture-making. His random spurts of wisdom are always a plus, and his demonstrations are truly crisp. If you want help, he'll give it to you. If you want to be independent, he'll leave you alone. In Intro he is more lenient in grading. Would take a class with him again if I could Projects are pretty demanding, but there isn't much outside work. Great demonstrations. Class is good for learning basic materials and methods, but there is absolutely NO conceptuality emphasized. Seems tough but is a nice guy if you show up and do the work. Expects a lot from his students. Grading fair. He means well, but can be very frustrating.  Likes to talk about his former students more than your work, and lecture about the ""Art World"" versus the rest of the world.  Also, if you're conceptually-inclined, beware - he won't address it.  He does help with formal/material qualities. He always pushed me until I produced the best I could. he was tough, but I really appreciated it. I never had a professor I worked so hard for.

He pushed my abilities as a reader and always expected the best from our class, which was a pretty intelligent group to begin with. This class is definitely more work than those grad taught FWS courses but you will actually learn about writing and reading with Braddock.  The Cold War class wasn't very cohesive, but it was all very interesting and Braddock is a great discussion leader. I always felt like I was learning a lot about the texts and he brought interesting perspectives. He is also clearly very excited about what he teaches, and I found him to be a fair and thorough grader. Probably one the nicest profs I have ever met. He leads great discussions in class, and you can tell he loves teaching and what he teaches. Kind of all over the place sometimes, but you will really learn a lot about the texts. He is kind-hearted and helpful. What is wrong with all these reviewers who do not appreciate an intelligent and peaceful approach? Discussion is set up to learn from him, the texts, and each other. Great discussion leader. He makes smart comments.  As for  racial diversity being odd, it's an American literature class.  Cultural diversity is important in understanding the different perspectives of American life.  The purpose of a class like this is to introduce people to different viewpoints that white ivy leaguers wouldn't normally read.","['Gives good feedback', 'Tough grader', ""Skip class?

I skipped lecture but be warned 10% of tests is stuff from lecture. Speaking of tests, impossibly difficult. Too many hard questions with not enough time. Averages are 50% By far the hardest class Ive ever taken. I only got a B+ in this class because I sacrificed all of my time for working out and going out to study for chem. The mean was around 50% on both prelims. Hector ridiculed students for not knowing answers in lecture. Even worse is that the class was 75% AP Chem students who already learned the material He might be a good researcher, but he's a terrible lecturer (his lectures are unintelligible). There are some cool demos that he does in class but some of them can be thrown in the exams. Tests are just ridiculously hard; do the problem sets posted on blackboard, they do help a lot. Lectures often consist of very cursory glances at topics, while tests go very in-depth to the same topics, and often include material that is not written on the slides/notes. Exam means are around 50%, so be ready for extremely hard tests. Best if you can teach yourself well. To succeed, you must put in tons of time out of class. He teaches straight from the textbook, which means you can pretty much do all the readings on your own and still make it. That said, the exams are really difficult with low averages(the first prelim was a raw 56).

Although there is a ton of reaction mechanisms he presents them in an enjoyable, experiment based, and easy to follow manner. Excellent prof! One of my favorite professors at cornell. Tests are hard but very straightforward; you know what you have to study. He's also really approachable and very willin to help students. His lectures are easy to follow because he follows the book word for word. He's a pretty nice guy and very helpful. His tests are much easier than the non-honors counter-part of this class, but they will still force you to learn all of the material taught. Pleasant experience. No Comments",[]

Louis  Falkson,"Heavily biased grading in History of Economic Analysis. The structure is that you essentially get 2 grades and they are weighted in some ambiguous way (not listed on syllabus) for your final grade. 8:40 class, provides useless feedback on papers, and is downright cold . Take anything else  Received a grade much lower than expected with no warning. For History of Economic Analysis with Falkson you will enjoy the material if you have the time in your schedule to devote to the class. You can also put in a modest effort and spend a lot of time on the two assignments, and still manage a good grade. Very smart guy. The professor is very nice and you can tell he truly loves teaching, so it's hard to complain because he definitely cares about his students. That said, this class was very disorganized. He would hop from one topic to the next and since he never used the textbook, I never knew how and where to study from. Good material, but all over the place. The guy below me must be high. Falkson may at times ramble and be incomprehensible, but his office hours are so helpful! The course material I found, for the most part, to be pretty difficult, but he was patient enough to help me through the material. I could not follow this guy at all during lecture. He didn't follow the book and he would change notation constantly. He also tended to ramble about macro theory. I really wish I had taken this course with Prof. Bar instead.","['Get ready to read', 'Tough grader', 'Participation matters', 'Amazing lectures', 'So many papers']"

You don't need to go to class, but if you don't, be sure to study a lot for the tests (get notes from a friend, since there are fill-in-the-blanks that she only tells you if you go to class). Would not recommend her class, but it's mandatory for Hotel. Varney is the worst educator of all time. My teachers in middle school taught me more than she has. Her class is exceptionally boring and it is shocking that she is employed by an Ivy League institution. She wastes so much paper by making students print slides that she is directly responsible for deforestation. AVOID !! Has the horrible habit of forcing attendance by leaving keywords on lecture notes BLANK. So that even if you want to study after the class for notes you missed, YOU CANT. (But words on the street is, her pointless effort can be compensated by searching ""HADM 3550 Quizlet"" on Google. Lectures are SO BORING. over-complicate simply things. I took Asset Management with Varney and was quite disappointed. I got an A and still felt like I didn't learn much at all.

I took Calculus 1 in high school, but was completely lost all semester. We never did practice problems in class (except for note examples). The tests were incredibly difficult and much harder than the assigned homework and class examples. He was completely unhelpful in office hours and was unable to clear up any confusion.

Christopher J. Earls,"I LOVED THIS CLASS!!! Made me really excited about Civil Engineering. The class was easy and interesting. Earls is really passionate about the material. Very helpful in office hours. No textbook, a few short homeworks, 1 paper, and a group project in the place of a final. The project was fun and a great way to apply the material. My favorite class. Lectures were pretty interesting compared to some other classes, but lasted a long time. The homeworks are easy if you go to office hours. I loved this class because the final project was so much fun, and there's no final.  The professor is AMAZING!!There is no textbook so pay attention to the lecture. However, the lecture is so long(over an hour) and there is no light because of the ppt, so you can fall asleep easily even though the lecture is interesting. There're no tests, only easy homework with only 2 or 3 short questions, include one group project and one paper. Made the class fun and applicable. While he didn't teach too much into the specifics of statics, mechanics, etc, the holistic approach was beneficial to the freshman class of engineers. The final project was superb and everyone had a good time with it Prof Earls did a good job with steel design. Lectures were very clear and well organized. Earls was always willing to help students. Homeworks really taught me about steel design. Tests were similar to homeworks, not too difficult. I recommend this course for a CEE design requirement. PS he's hot!","['Group projects', 'Tests?

Robin  McNeal,"Just randomly assign grades to students. Students who work hard and participate actively in class ended up getting lower grades Doesn't allow for your own interpretation of the theories and readings. It's his way or the highway. Class has a separate clique of people who defend everything he says and therefore succeed in his class. Had good impression at first, but then realized he gives preferential treatment to a select few and grades are completely based on his opinion. Even if your paper is well-written, if he doesn't agree with you said, expect to get a much lower grade than what you deserve. If you manage to get on his good side, then all is well. Would not take again. McNeal is my fav prof at Cornell. He's incredibly passionate about his field and is very flexible and considerate. He makes the material interesting and so long as you attend lectures, read most readings, take your time on the essays, and study your notes you'll get a good grade. It was 100% worth getting up early to attend his lectures every week. Really enthusiastic and knowledgeable of his subject. That being said, he goes off on tangents really easily. Fun to listen to still. As long as you go to lecture, quizzes and papers are really easy. Don't think he gave below an 86 on first paper.

Encourages b.s. speculation without careful analysis, though she claims evidence is important.  Needs training on scientific method.  Material is useless for 99% of students. Open ended test questions. Does not help with papers at all, and is an extremely tough grader. Mean and not constructive paper comments Annetta is one of my favorite professors at Cornell; yes, her tests are tricky, so you actually have to know what you are doing-she doesn't abide by the grade inflation many others do (good for her!) She is so helpful!  She goes out of her way to help students with anything they need, and she is seriously brilliant. You will learn a ton with A.A.

That being said, the museum visits are interesting and the guest lectures can be a hit or miss. Reading wise, she or the lectures assign a lot and then act sorry it was complex. at most 3 absence in lecture or you will fail. lots of readings for an intro 1000-level course. barely any homework besides readings and two papers. HEAVY accent and low voice! yet the worst part is she does not give any slides and notes for every lecture are required to upload. gives very little information about the course and doesnt communicate I really like her class, but if you are not into theory, then I advise you against her class because her classes are usually theory-heavy. If you can write coherently (be truthful with yourself,) then you should have no trouble getting a decent grade in this class since it is based on 4 3-4 pg essays. She does a terrible job of explaining the topics and can't seem to figure out how a projector works. Despite this, the class has many guest lectures (some more than others interesting).

Literally no one has any idea what was going on in the class. The lectures were so dry and what we were being tested on was extremely unclear. Lectures were pretty dry, but necessary to attend since powerpoints weren't posted online. Your discussion TA makes all the difference!

Huseyin  Topaloglu,"Definitely one of the best Professor who can make things crystal clear, make everything in class interesting and make everyone so involved! Love this guy! I love this professor. His lectures seems easy at first, but he will lead to some real knowledge before your realize that. It gonna take much longer time to learn all those stuff by yourself. Great teacher! I wish I had taken his course in undergrad! A professor whom I'd take another class with just because he is good. He cares about the students academic-wise AND just as a person. Class is not that hard. Wonderful professor-one of the best Cornell has to offer. Really passionate about the course material and really dedicated to his students. Funny guy- not afraid to call people out during lecture- all in good fun. Very helpful, great teaching style and wit. Readily available for assistance on otherwise complicated concepts. He was also voted best prof by the students for the past two years. Highly recommended!",['Amazing lectures']

Dana M. Radcliffe,"Ethics is such an open ended subject and yet he grades the papers really harshly. For a 1.5 credit class, he gives way too much work...3 short papers and 1 long paper. No Comments","['Tough grader', 'Get ready to read', 'So many papers']"

Kate  McCullough,"McCullough is great. Super sweet and actually cares a lot about her students and what she's teaching. I definitely recommend if you're willing to work really hard (especially on essays), do lot's of reading, and participate in class. You will learn if you show up!","['Gives good feedback', 'Tough grader', 'Caring', 'Get ready to read', 'Participation matters']"

Kyle M. Lancaster,He's the best. He loves to blow things up and is the best and most entertaining teacher! His explosive personality really makes the class interesting and bearable. 15/10 would recommend.,"['Respected', 'Amazing lectures', 'Hilarious', ""Skip class? You won't pass."", 'Test heavy']"

Renate  Ferro,"Basically doesn't teach and expects you to know by Googling everything. She doesnt know the material very well and does not do a good job of explaining especially those who dont have an understanding of the material before. I feel like Renate has a lot of ideas about aligning practice with the behavior of the innovative art world itself. She often ends up going on in lectures about all these ""ideas,"" but never teaches technique. As long as you know what you want, what your ideas are, and you can show her you're always a step of ahead of the game, she'll be impressed. Terrible Renate is the nicest instructors I've encountered at Cornell and always willing to go out of her way to help you out.  Didn't always teach the most direct way to use each computer program, but taught us that the best way to learn how to use PhotoShop and Video editing software is to simply play around with it. Very little work outside class.","[""Skip class? You won't pass."", 'Lots of homework']"
Chris  Xu,"A great lecturer, but may go off on (very interesting) tangents and not get through all he planned, but it will still be on the test. That or it all gets repeated in the next lecture, you never know. Very accessible outside of class and I'd recommend going to every lecture and office hours to learn and because of how funnily quotable he is.","['Tough grader', 'Lots of homework', 'Amazing lectures', 'Would take again', 'Gives good feedback']"
Dan  Lorey,"The class starts out pretty easy, but after the first prelim, picks up speed pretty quickly. Dr. Lorey is a great professor, if something isn't clear to you during class, hes good for in class questions and provides plenty of office hours for you to get help.","['Clear grading criteria', 'Gives good feedback', 'Amazing lectures', 'Lots of homework', 'Hilarious']"

Saida  Hodzic,"I loved this class! Hodzic is a good professor - her lectures are always about readings for homework (if you want a good grade, you need to talk in the class). They're usually really cool though. Discussion section helps with your grade, and the papers are actually interesting, not boring. Very manageable to do well in if you do the bare minimum.","['Get ready to read', 'Participation matters', 'Inspirational', 'So many papers', 'Accessible outside class']"

Robert  Connelly,"Sometimes has a tough time communicating exactly what he is trying to say, but gets the job done at the end of the day. Very understanding and super generous with final grades.

Joseph R. Fetcho,"The best professor of my life.   If you ask Fetcho he will happily show you all of the course evaluations for any course he teaches.  You can then see what all of the students thought rather than some arbitrary subset on this site. Very interesting course. There's a nice option to not take the final, if you're satisfied with your grade up to then. Lectures were a tad unorganized, but the content was well-explained. On a sidenote, as a med student, taking this class made conversations w/ PhD students comprehensible. Dr. Fetcho is brilliant and an excellent professor. I highly recommend this class to anyone who is willing to work hard. Interesting material, and a great overview of the scientific method as applied to neuro and genetics.  Most valuable for the big picture, but certain technique-related details (ie. cre/lox systems, etc) that are essential in understanding today's research are communicated clearly and emphasized repeatedly.  Great course and hilarious professor.","[""Skip class? You won't pass."", 'Amazing lectures', 'Clear grading criteria', 'Lots of homework', 'Beware of pop quizzes']"
